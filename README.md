This repository contains some basic data structures and algorithms implemented in Python:

* [Array](array_ops.py)
* [Cuboid](cuboid.py)
* [Data Types](data_types.py)
* [Dictionary](dictionary.py)
* [List](lists.py)
* [List Comprehension](list_compre.py)
* [Queue](queue_ops.py) (using array)
* [Stack](stack_ops.py) (using array)
* [Tuples](tuples.py)
* [Time-Tuples](time-tuple.py)

This repository is for learning purpose. All the codes are tested and verified. The codes are written in a simple way so that it can be easily understood by the beginners. The codes are written with proper comments and docstrings for better understanding. The codes are tested in Python 3.8.
